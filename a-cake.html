<h5>Apple cake is a popular dessert produced with the 
    main ingredient of apples. Such a cake is made through
     the process of slicing this sweet fruit to add fragrance to a plain cake base.
      Traditional apple cakes go a step further by including various spices such as nutmeg or cinnamon,
       which give a unique flavour. Upon the addition of spices the batter can also be accompanied by crushed nuts, 
       the most popular being walnuts and almonds.</h5>
